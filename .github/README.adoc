These are some utilities that are too tiny to have their own home.

`grep_`:: Runs `grep --color=auto`, passing along any given arguments.

`ls_`:: Runs `ls -AFh`, passing along any given arguments.  If `-A` is
not recognized, then `-a` is used instead; other unrecognized options
are omitted without replacement.  (Option support is tested at build
time.)


== Requirements

:url-posix: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities
:url-zsh: https://zsh.sourceforge.io

* A
https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/[Bourne,
title=~sven_mascheck/ - The Traditional Bourne Shell Family]
or
{url-posix}/V3_chap02.html[POSIX,
title=POSIX.1-2017 - XCU Chapter 2 ('Shell Command Language')](-ish)
shell.  The shells I have at hand are
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[bash],
http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/[dash],
http://www.kornshell.org[ksh93],
http://mirbsd.de/mksh[mksh],
https://yash.osdn.jp[yash],
and
{url-zsh}[zsh];
other shells are supported on a best-effort basis.  (NB: zsh must be
used in
{url-zsh}/Doc/Release/Invocation.html#Compatibility[ksh or sh
compatibility mode, title=Z Shell Manual - Section 4.2 ('Compatibility')].)

* A typical Unix(-like) toolset, including:

** `grep(1)` with `--color=auto`

** `{url-posix}/m4.html[m4(1),
title=POSIX.1-2017 - XCU Chapter 4 ('Utilities - m4')]`
(for build only)

** `{url-posix}/make.html[make(1),
title=POSIX.1-2017 - XCU Chapter 4 ('Utilities - make')]`
(for build only)

* https://www.shellcheck.net[ShellCheck]
(for `make check` only)


== Installation and uninstallation

ifdef::env-github[]
:link-makefile: link:../Makefile
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
:link-makefile: https://github.com/larryv/binfiles/blob/main/Makefile
endif::[]

Run these commands from the directory containing
`{link-makefile}[the makefile]`.  (Using `make -C` is fine.)  If
necessary, acquire privileges with
`https://www.sudo.ws[sudo(1)]`,
`https://man.openbsd.org/doas[doas(1),
title=OpenBSD manual pages - doas(1)]`,
etc.

* To install under `/usr/local` (the default) or some other path:
+
--
[source]
make install

[source]
make prefix=/some/other/path install
--

* To uninstall from `/usr/local` (the default) or some other path:
+
--
[source]
make uninstall

[source]
make prefix=/some/other/path uninstall
--

* To run basic tests:
+
[source]
make check

* To clean up:
+
[source]
make clean

:title-make-man-cmdvars: {title-make-man} - \
    Variables for Specifying Commands
:title-make-man-dirvars: {title-make-man} - \
    Variables for Installation Directories

:url-make-man-cmdvars: {url-make-man}/Command-Variables.html
:url-make-man-dirvars: {url-make-man}/Directory-Variables.html

The following `make(1)` macros are available for modifying the build
process (as demonstrated above with `prefix`).  Refer to
{link-makefile}[the makefile] for their default values.

* `{url-make-man-dirvars}#index-bindir[bindir,
title={title-make-man-dirvars} - bindir]`,
`{url-make-man}/DESTDIR.html[DESTDIR,
title={title-make-man} - DESTDIR: Support for Staged Installs]`,
`{url-make-man-dirvars}#index-exec_005fprefix[exec_prefix,
title={title-make-man-dirvars} - exec_prefix]`,
and
`{url-make-man-dirvars}#index-prefix[prefix,
title={title-make-man-dirvars} - prefix]`
are installation directories.

* `GREP` is the `grep(1)` command hard-coded into `grep_`.

* `LS` is the `ls(1)` command hard-coded into `ls_`.

* `SHELL` is the shell invoked by `make(1)` and hard-coded into the
shebangs of shell scripts.

* `{url-make-man-cmdvars}[INSTALL,
title={title-make-man-cmdvars}]`,
`{url-make-man-cmdvars}[INSTALL_PROGRAM,
title={title-make-man-cmdvars}]`,
`M4` (with `M4FLAGS`) and `SHELLCHECK` (with `SHELLCHECKFLAGS`) are
commands invoked by the build process.
